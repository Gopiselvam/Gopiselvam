Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a Java enthusiast with expertise in Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes. I've also mastered Kafka, REST APIs, Kong Gateway, and databases such as Postgres, Redis, and Neo4j. While Java is my forte, I'm not a one-trick pony - I also have a solid foundation in Python, Angular, and React. I'm passionate about building scalable, reliable, and high-performance software solutions that solve real-world problems.

With my diverse skill set, I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting new projects and explore innovative technologies. Feel free to browse my repositories and check out some of my latest work. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
